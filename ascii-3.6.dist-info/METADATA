Modification-Details: loadFromUrl originally received 3 arguments and now receives 4. The added argument is: rows, with the default signature now being: loadFromUrl(URL, columns=60, rows=None, color=True).
A new module has been created with the signature: loadFromFile(image_file, columns=60, rows=None, color=True), which converts images stored on the computer into ASCII.
